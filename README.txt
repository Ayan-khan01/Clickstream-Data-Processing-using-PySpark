Clickstream Data Processing
Overview

This repository contains code for processing clickstream data using various technologies, including Kafka, Elasticsearch, HBase, and Apache Spark. The code is designed to ingest, process, and store clickstream data, making it easy to analyze and gain insights from large volumes of clickstream events.
Files Included

    kafka_clickstream_producer.py
        Description: A Kafka producer script that generates dummy clickstream data and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
        Purpose: To simulate and generate sample clickstream data for processing.

    kafka_clickstream_consumer.py
        Description: A Kafka consumer script that consumes clickstream data from the Kafka topic and processes it.
        Purpose: To ingest clickstream data from Kafka and prepare it for further processing.

    elasticsearch_s3_data_processor.py
        Description: A script that reads processed clickstream data, stores it in AWS S3 in CSV format, and indexes it into Elasticsearch.
        Purpose: To store and index processed clickstream data in Elasticsearch for search and analysis.

    hbase_store.py
        Description: A script that stores ingested clickstream data into HBase.
        Purpose: To store raw clickstream data in HBase for future analysis.

    spark_processing.py
        Description: A script that processes clickstream data stored in HBase using Apache Spark.
        Purpose: To analyze and aggregate clickstream data using Spark SQL queries.

How to Use

    Ensure you have the required dependencies installed for each script, such as Kafka, Elasticsearch, HBase, and Spark.

    Update the configurations in each script to match your environment. Replace placeholders like YOUR_KAFKA_BROKER_ADDRESS, YOUR_ELASTICSEARCH_HOST, YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME, etc., with your actual configurations.

    Make sure you have data available for processing. For the Kafka producer, you can generate dummy clickstream data. For the other scripts, ensure you have the necessary data sources available.

    Execute the scripts in the following order:
        Run kafka_clickstream_producer.py to produce dummy clickstream data to the Kafka topic.
        Run kafka_clickstream_consumer.py to consume and process the clickstream data from Kafka.
        Run elasticsearch_s3_data_processor.py to store the processed data in AWS S3 and index it into Elasticsearch.
        Run hbase_store.py to store raw clickstream data in HBase.
        Run spark_processing.py to process and analyze clickstream data using Apache Spark.

Note

Please exercise caution while running these scripts, especially in production environments. Make sure to use real clickstream data responsibly and follow best practices for data processing and storage.
